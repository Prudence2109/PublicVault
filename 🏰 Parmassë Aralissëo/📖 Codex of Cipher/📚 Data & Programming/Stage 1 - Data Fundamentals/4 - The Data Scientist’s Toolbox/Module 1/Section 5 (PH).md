# **📌 5️⃣ The Data Science Process – Structured Notes**  

---

### **✅ The Data Science Process Overview**  

✔ **Every Data Science project follows a structured workflow:**  
  1️⃣ **Define a clear question**  
  2️⃣ **Gather and clean data**  
  3️⃣ **Explore, analyze, and model the data**  
  4️⃣ **Communicate findings effectively**  

✔ **Data Science projects can address both serious public health issues (e.g., opioid overdoses) and personal curiosity (e.g., baby name trends).**  

### 🔎 **Public Health Significance**  
✔ **Epidemiology & Disease Surveillance** – Data-driven methods help identify **outbreak trends and emerging health threats** (e.g., COVID-19, Dengue).  
✔ **Health Policy & Administration** – Data science informs **evidence-based policymaking** and optimizes healthcare resource allocation.  
✔ **Pharmacoeconomics & Health Economics** – Cost-effectiveness analyses leverage **big data to guide healthcare investments**.  
✔ **Implementation Science & Social & Administrative Pharmacy** – Evaluates **real-world effectiveness of interventions** and improves service delivery.

### **📌 Step-by-Step Breakdown of a Data Science Project**  

---

#### **🧐 Step 1: Define a Clear Question**  

- The project must start with a **well-defined** question.  
- Additional questions may emerge during analysis, but a clear starting point is crucial.  

✅ **Example: Public Health Application**  
- **Question:** *Can machine learning models predict which patients are at the highest risk for opioid overdoses?*  
- **Significance:** Predictive modeling helps **target high-risk populations** for early intervention.  

✅ **Example: Hilary Parker’s Analysis**  
- **Question:** *Is "Hilary/Hillary" really the most rapidly “poisoned” baby name in recorded U.S. history?*

#### **📊 Step 2: Collect & Prepare the Data**  

✔ **Find or generate data** relevant to the question.  
✔ **Clean and structure the data** for analysis (may involve web scraping, APIs, or database queries).  

✅ **Example: Public Health Data Collection**  
- Extracting **electronic medical records (EMRs)** to analyze **chronic disease trends**.  
- Pulling **social determinants of health (SDH) data** from the **Census Bureau** for health equity research.  
- Using **geospatial data** to track **infectious disease outbreaks**.  

✅ **Example: Hilary Parker’s Data Collection**  
- Pulled **baby name data** (1880-2011) from the **Social Security website**.  
- Worked with **4,110 names** to calculate **relative risk for name popularity changes**.  

---

#### **🔍 Step 3: Explore & Analyze the Data**  

✔ **Initial Exploration:**  
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.  

✔ **Statistical Modeling:**  
- Use **relative risk calculations** to measure changes in data trends.  

✅ **Example: Public Health Analysis**  
- **Epidemiology:** Using **logistic regression** to assess **risk factors for cardiovascular disease**.  
- **Pharmacoeconomics:** Analyzing **real-world adherence rates** for high-cost medications.  

✅ **Example: Hilary’s Findings**  
- Calculated **relative risk** for name popularity drops.  
- Found **Hilary had the sharpest decline in popularity post-1992**.  

---

### **📈 Step 4: Data Visualization & Deeper Analysis**  

✔ **Visualizing Data Helps Identify Patterns**  
- Charts, graphs, and trend lines **make the data more understandable**.  

✅ **Example: Public Health Data Visualization**  
- **Choropleth maps** for tracking **disease prevalence by region**.  
- **Time-series graphs** showing **COVID-19 cases over time**.  

✅ **Example: Hilary’s Data Visualizations**  
- Created **line plots** showing baby name trends over time.  
	![[Pasted image 20250218233747.png]]  
- Compared names with **short-lived spikes vs. long-term popularity drops**.

### **🖥️ Step 5: Communicate the Results**  

✔ **Final Analysis is Summarized & Shared**  
- Can be in the form of a **policy report, research paper, dashboard, or public health advisory**.  

✔ **Good Data Science Communication:**  
- Clearly states the question and answer.  
- Uses **data visualizations** for clarity.  
- **Acknowledges previous work & data sources**.  

✅ **Example: Public Health Reporting**  
- **Health Policy Reports**: WHO & CDC publish **real-time disease reports** to guide interventions.  
- **Healthcare Dashboards**: Hospitals use **predictive analytics dashboards** for patient risk stratification.  

✅ **Example: Hilary’s Blog Post**  
- Published findings in an **entertaining & insightful way**.  
- Provided **R code on GitHub** for transparency and reproducibility.

### **📌 Other Real-World Data Science Project Examples**  

✔ **Predicting Opioid Overdose Risks**  
- **University of Pennsylvania Masters Students** built a **Shiny App** using R.  
- Used **opioid data to predict overdose risks in Providence, RI**.  
	![[Pasted image 20250218234017.png]]  

✔ **COVID-19 Case Prediction Models**  
- **Epidemiologists** developed machine learning models to **forecast COVID-19 waves** and guide healthcare planning.  

✔ **Sexual Health Clinics Map**  
- **Charlotte Galvin** used **open data from Toronto** to **map sexual health clinics**.  

✔ **Pharmacoeconomics & Drug Pricing Models**  
- Health economists use data science to **estimate the cost-effectiveness of new drugs**.
