![[Pasted image 20250217200908.png]]  

✔ **A Set of Values** → Data involves **multiple items (population)**.  
✔ **Variables** → Measurements or characteristics of an item.  
✔ **Types of Variables:**  
  - **Qualitative (Categorical)** → Describes **qualities**, e.g., country of origin, gender, treatment group.  
  - **Quantitative (Numerical)** → Represents **measurable quantities**, e.g., height, weight, blood pressure.  

📌 **Public Health Applications:**  
✔ **Epidemiological Studies** – Identifying **risk factors for diseases** (e.g., BMI vs. diabetes risk).  
✔ **Health Behavior Research** – Studying **smoking cessation trends** by analyzing demographic data.  
✔ **Health Policy Design** – Measuring **social determinants of health (SDH)** for intervention planning.  

📌 **Summary:**  
Data consists of **measurements on a set of items**, categorized as **qualitative or quantitative**, and plays a crucial role in shaping **public health research and interventions**.
