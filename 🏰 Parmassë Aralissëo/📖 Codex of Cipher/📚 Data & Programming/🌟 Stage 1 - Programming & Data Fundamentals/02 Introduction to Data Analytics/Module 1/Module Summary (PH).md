### **📈 The Four Types of Data Analysis in Public Health**  

|**Type**|**Key Question Answered**|**Public Health Use Case**|  
|---|---|---|  
|**Descriptive Analytics**|"What happened?"|Tracking **infection rates during an outbreak** (e.g., COVID-19, dengue, tuberculosis).|  
|**Diagnostic Analytics**|"Why did it happen?"|Investigating **disparities in vaccination rates** among socio-economic groups.|  
|**Predictive Analytics**|"What will happen next?"|Forecasting **hospital readmission risks** and **disease burden trends**.|  
|**Prescriptive Analytics**|"What should be done?"|Optimizing **public health policies, resource allocation, and intervention strategies**.|  

📌 **The Data Analysis Process in Public Health** involves:  
1️⃣ Identifying the health problem (e.g., **tobacco use and lung cancer incidence**).  
2️⃣ Collecting and cleaning health data for **reliability**.  
3️⃣ Performing **biostatistical analysis & risk assessment**.  
4️⃣ Communicating findings to **government agencies, NGOs, and healthcare providers**.  

🔹 **Example:** The **CDC used predictive analytics to model flu outbreaks**, allowing **proactive vaccine stockpiling and distribution**.
