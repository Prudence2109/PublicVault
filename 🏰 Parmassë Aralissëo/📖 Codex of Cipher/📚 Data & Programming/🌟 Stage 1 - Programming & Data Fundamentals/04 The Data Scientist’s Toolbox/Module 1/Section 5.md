### **✅ The Data Science Process Overview**  

✔ **Every Data Science project starts with a question.**  
✔ **Data is collected or generated** to answer that question.  
✔ **Data is analyzed** through exploration and modeling (statistical/machine learning techniques).  
✔ **Findings must be communicated** – via reports, blogs, presentations, or interactive tools.  

---

### **📌 Step-by-Step Breakdown of a Data Science Project**  

---
#### **🧐 Step 1: Define a Clear Question**  

- A well-defined question guides the entire analysis.  
- New questions may emerge during the analysis.  

✅ **Example: Hilary Parker’s Analysis**  
 **Question:** *Is "Hilary/Hillary" the most rapidly “poisoned” baby name in recorded U.S. history?*  

---
#### **📊 Step 2: Collect & Prepare the Data**  

✔ **Data is acquired from relevant sources.**  
✔ **Data is cleaned and structured** for analysis.  
✔ Often requires **web scraping, APIs, or working with large datasets.**  

✅ **Example: Hilary Parker’s Data Collection**  
 - Pulled **baby name data** (1880-2011) from the **Social Security website**.  
 - Worked with **4,110 names** to calculate **relative risk for name popularity changes**.  

---
#### **🔍 Step 3: Explore & Analyze the Data**  

✔ **Initial Exploration:**  
 - Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.  

✔ **Statistical Modeling:**  
 - Using **relative risk** to measure how name popularity changed over time.  

✅ **Example: Hilary’s Findings**  
 - Calculated **relative risk** for name popularity drops.  
 - Compared names that had **sudden vs. gradual declines**.  
 - Found **Hilary had the sharpest decline in popularity post-1992**.  

---
#### **🖥️ Step 4: Communicate the Results**  

✔ **Final Analysis is Summarized & Shared**  
 - Can be in the form of a **blog post, report, presentation, or interactive dashboard**.  

✔ **Good Data Science Communication:**  
 - Clearly states the question and answer.  
 - Uses **data visualizations** for clarity.  
 - **Acknowledges previous work & data sources**.  

✅ **Example: Hilary’s Blog Post**  
 - Published findings in an **entertaining & insightful way**.  
 - Provided **R code on GitHub** for transparency and reproducibility.  
 - Credited **other researchers & sources**.  

---
### **📌 Other Real-World Data Science Project Examples**  

✔ **Predicting Opioid Overdose Risks**  
 - **University of Pennsylvania Masters Students** built a **Shiny App** using R.  
 - Used **opioid data to predict overdose risks in Providence, RI**.  

✔ **Trump’s Tweets Analysis**  
 - **David Robinson** analyzed **Trump’s tweets**, showing **angrier tweets were written by Trump himself**.  

✔ **Sexual Health Clinics Map**  
 - **Charlotte Galvin** used **open data from Toronto** to **map sexual health clinics**.  

✔ **Best Places to Live in the U.S. (Based on Weather Preferences)**  
 - **Maelle Samuel** analyzed climate data to determine **ideal living locations**.

### **🔎 Key Takeaways from the Data Science Process**  

✔ **All data science projects follow a similar workflow:**  
  1️⃣ **Define a clear question**  
   2️⃣ **Gather and clean data**  
   3️⃣ **Explore, analyze, and model the data**  
   4️⃣ **Communicate findings effectively**  

✔ **Data Science Can Address a Wide Range of Questions**  
 - **Serious Topics:** *Can we predict opioid overdose risks?*  
 - **Fun & Personal Topics:** *What’s the most rapidly “poisoned” baby name?*  

✔ **Effective Communication is Crucial**  
 - Use **visualizations & summaries** to explain findings.  
 - Share work openly (**GitHub, blogs, presentations**).  

🚀 **By the end of this course series, you'll be able to carry out your own full data science projects using R!**

### **✅ The Data Science Process Overview**  

✔ **Every Data Science project follows a structured workflow:**  
   1️⃣ **Define a clear question**  
   2️⃣ **Gather and clean data**  
   3️⃣ **Explore, analyze, and model the data**  
   4️⃣ **Communicate findings effectively**  

✔ **Data Science projects can answer serious questions (e.g., opioid overdoses) or personal curiosity (e.g., baby name trends).**

### **📌 Step-by-Step Breakdown of a Data Science Project**  

---
#### **🧐 Step 1: Define a Clear Question**  

- The project must start with a **well-defined** question.  
- Additional questions may emerge during analysis, but a clear starting point is crucial.  

✅ **Example: Hilary Parker’s Analysis**  
 **Question:** *Is "Hilary/Hillary" really the most rapidly “poisoned” baby name in recorded U.S. history?*

#### **📊 Step 2: Collect & Prepare the Data**  

✔ **Find or generate data** relevant to the question.  
✔ **Clean and structure the data** for analysis (may involve web scraping, APIs, or database queries).  

✅ **Example: Hilary Parker’s Data Collection**  
 - Pulled **baby name data** (1880-2011) from the **Social Security website**.  
 - Worked with **4,110 names** to calculate **relative risk for name popularity changes**.

 - Charts, graphs, and trend lines **make the data more understandable**.  

✅ **Example: Hilary’s Data Visualizations**  
 - Created **line plots** showing baby name trends over time.  
	   ![[Pasted image 20250218233747.png]]
 - Compared names with **short-lived spikes vs. long-term popularity drops**.
