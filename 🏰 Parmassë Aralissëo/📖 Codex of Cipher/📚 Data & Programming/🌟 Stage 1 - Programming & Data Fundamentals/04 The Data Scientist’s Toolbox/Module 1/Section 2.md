### **📈 Why is Data Science Growing?**  

- **Explosion of Data** 📊  
  - More data is being collected now than ever before.  
  - Example: The **Library of Alexandria** (3rd century BC) housed what was then considered the sum of human knowledge.  
  - Today, **each person has access to 320x that information**, and it's still growing.  

- **Rise of Affordable Computing** 💻  
  - Cheaper and **faster processors** 🖥️  
  - **Increased memory capabilities**  
  - More software and tools for data analysis

### **📊 The Three Vs of Big Data**  

1️⃣ **Volume** – Large datasets are the norm.  
   - Example: **YouTube** → 300+ hours of video uploaded per **minute**.  
2️⃣ **Velocity** – Data is generated and collected at high speed.  
   - Example: **GPS tracking of transport trucks** in real-time.  
3️⃣ **Variety** – Data comes in different formats (structured & unstructured).  
   - Example: **YouTube data** includes **videos, audio, views, comments, and metadata**.
