## **📌 Steps to Take Before Asking for Help**  

### **🔍 1️⃣ Solve the Problem Yourself First**  

💡 **Check the Documentation**  
 - Read **manuals & help files** first (e.g., in R: `?command`).  
 - Avoid asking **basic questions** easily answered in the documentation.  
 - **Public Health Example:**  
   ✔ Epidemiologists troubleshooting **R packages for disease modeling** often find solutions in official documentation.  

💡 **Google & Search Relevant Forums**  
 - **Best forums for data science help:**  
   - **Stack Overflow** (general programming)  
   - **Cross Validated** (statistics)  
   - **Course Forum** (for peer discussions)  
 - Before posting, **search to see if your question has already been answered**.  
 - **Public Health Example:**  
   ✔ Health analysts working on **electronic health records (EHRs)** may find existing solutions for common **data cleaning** issues.  

💡 **Look for Tutorials & FAQs**  
 - Many issues are covered in **FAQs, vignettes, and guides**.  
 - **Public Health Example:**  
   ✔ Global health researchers using **GIS mapping for outbreak tracking** often find pre-existing tutorials on spatial analysis.

### **🖥️ 2️⃣ Debugging & Troubleshooting Strategies**  

#### **1️⃣ Coding Errors & Fixes**  

💥 **Error Messages**  
 - If a command **produces no data** and gives an **error message**:  
   - **Check for typos**.  
   - **Read & understand the error message**.  
   - **Google the exact error message** – chances are someone has encountered it.  
 - **Public Health Example:**  
   ✔ A **pharmacoeconomist debugging a Markov model in R** may find solutions by searching for specific error messages on **health economics forums**.  

💡 **Unexpected Output**  
 - If the output **isn’t what you expected**:  
   - **Compare expected vs. actual results**.  
   - **Think logically about what the command did**.  
   - Often, the code is **doing exactly what you told it to do, just not what you wanted**.  
 - **Public Health Example:**  
   ✔ Health policy analysts testing **cost-effectiveness simulations** may need to debug why intervention costs appear incorrect in their model.

### **👥 3️⃣ Asking for Help Effectively**  

✔ **Seek a Peer First**  
 - **Explaining a problem to someone else** often helps you realize the solution.  
 - In this course, **use the course forum** to ask classmates.  
 - **Public Health Example:**  
   ✔ Public health professionals working on **community health interventions** can collaborate with colleagues to troubleshoot evaluation methods.  

✔ **Rubber Duck Debugging 🦆**  
 - Explain the problem **out loud** (to a rubber duck or a colleague).  
 - **Often, the act of explaining reveals the mistake.**  
 - *Inspired by "The Pragmatic Programmer" debugging technique.*  
 - **Public Health Example:**  
   ✔ Epidemiologists designing **infectious disease models** can identify issues by talking through assumptions with a colleague.  

✔ **Posting on a Forum – Best Practices**  
 - **Provide clear, specific details**:  
   - **What problem are you trying to solve?**  
   - **What steps have you already taken?**  
   - **Include sample data** to help troubleshoot.  
   - **Explain expected vs. actual output**.  
   - **Include error messages**.  
   - **Mention your operating system & software version (e.g., R version, packages).**  
 - **Public Health Example:**  
   ✔ A **global health researcher posting about GIS data issues** should specify **coordinate system errors and software versions**.  

✔ **How to Title Your Post**  
 - **Bad Examples:**  
   ❌ HELP! Can’t fit linear model!  
   ❌ HELP! Don’t understand PCA!  
 - **Better Examples:**  
   ✅ R 3.4.3 `lm()` function produces seg fault with large data frame (Windows 10)  
   ✅ Applied PCA to a matrix - what are U, D, and Vt?  
 - **Best Examples:**  
   ✅ R 3.4.3 `lm()` function on Windows 10 – seg fault on large dataframe  
   ✅ Using principal components to discover common variation in matrix rows – should I use U, D, or Vt?  
 - **Public Health Example:**  
   ✔ **"R 4.2.1: Issue with `ggplot2` for Visualizing Disease Surveillance Data – Missing Data Handling?"**

### **🌐 4️⃣ Forum Etiquette – Do’s & Don’ts**  

✅ **Do:**  
 ✔ Read the forum guidelines.  
 ✔ Make sure your question is in the **appropriate forum**.  
 ✔ Describe **your goal & problem explicitly**.  
 ✔ Provide the **minimum information needed** to reproduce the problem.  
 ✔ Be **courteous** (say **please & thank you**!).  
 ✔ **Follow up** on your post (thank people & post the solution).  

❌ **Don’t:**  
 ❌ Assume the software is broken – **it’s usually user error**.  
 ❌ Ask people to **do your homework for you**.  
 ❌ Cross-post the same question **on multiple forums**.  
 ❌ Repost your question **if you don’t get an immediate response**.  

📌 **Public Health Relevance:**  
✔ **Epidemiologists & Data Analysts** – Collaborative debugging ensures the accuracy of **disease models and risk factor analyses**.  
✔ **Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Experts** – Transparent problem-solving methods enhance **credibility in health economic evaluations**.  
✔ **Pharmacoeconomists & Health Policy Analysts** – Well-structured forum posts lead to better **reproducibility in cost-effectiveness research**.
