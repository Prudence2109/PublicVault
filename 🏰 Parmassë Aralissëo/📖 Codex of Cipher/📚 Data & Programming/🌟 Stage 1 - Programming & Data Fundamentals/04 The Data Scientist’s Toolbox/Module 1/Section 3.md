### **✅ What is Data?**  

- **Definition 1 (Cambridge English Dictionary):**  
  - Data = **Information, especially facts or numbers**, collected for **examination and decision-making**.  
- **Definition 2 (Wikipedia):**  
  - Data = **A set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables**.  
  - **Key Takeaways:**  
    ✔ Data consists of **facts, numbers, and values**.  
    ✔ It is **collected, examined, and used to inform decisions**.  

---

### **📊 Key Concepts in Data**  

✔ **A Set of Values** → Data involves **multiple items (population)**.  
✔ **Variables** → Measurements or characteristics of an item.  
✔ **Types of Variables:**  
  - **Qualitative (Categorical)** → Describes **qualities**, e.g., country of origin, gender, treatment group.  
  - **Quantitative (Numerical)** → Represents **measurable quantities**, e.g., height, weight, blood pressure.  

📌 **Summary:**  
Data consists of **measurements on a set of items**, categorized as **qualitative or quantitative**.  

---

### **📉 Structured vs. Messy Data**  

- **Ideal Data Presentation:**  
  - Organized in **structured tables**, with individuals in **rows** and variables in **columns**.  
- **Real-World Data Challenges:**  
  - Data is often **messy, unstructured, or incomplete**.  
  - Extracting useful information requires **data wrangling & cleaning**.  

---

### **📂 Examples of Data Sources & Their Challenges**  


🔹 **Genomic Sequencing Data 🧬**  
- **Raw format:** FASTQ files with **millions of lines of genetic sequences**.  
- **Challenge:** Must **parse & analyze** to extract insights about individual genomes.  
- **Example:** Processed into **Volcano Plots** to visualize gene expressions.  

🔹 **Census Data 🏢**  
- **Collected from entire populations** via **nationwide surveys**.  
- **Challenge:** Large datasets with **thousands of variables**, requiring **querying & processing**.  
- **Example:** **Population Pyramid Charts** → Shows **age & gender distribution**.  

🔹 **Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) 🏥**  
- **Patient health data stored digitally.**  
- **Challenge:** Data must be **extracted, categorized, and cleaned** for large-scale **health studies**.  
- **Example:** Identifying **common allergies in a population** from medical histories.  

🔹 **Image & Video Data 📷🎥**  
- **Large, complex data requiring machine learning to analyze.**  
- **Example:**  
  - **Facebook’s Face Recognition** → Detects faces & suggests names.  
  - **Google’s Deep Dream & Quick Draw AI** → Uses machine learning to analyze & interpret images.  

📌 **Key Takeaway:** Most real-world data is **unstructured and requires significant preprocessing** before it can be analyzed.

### **📌 The Role of Data in Data Science**  

✔ **Data is important, but it is secondary to your question.**  
✔ **Good data scientists focus on questions first, then seek relevant data.**  
✔ **The availability of data may shape your question, but it should not drive it.**  

📌 **Summary:** Data can come in structured or unstructured formats from various sources. The key skill in data science is **cleaning, organizing, and interpreting data** to answer meaningful questions. 🚀
