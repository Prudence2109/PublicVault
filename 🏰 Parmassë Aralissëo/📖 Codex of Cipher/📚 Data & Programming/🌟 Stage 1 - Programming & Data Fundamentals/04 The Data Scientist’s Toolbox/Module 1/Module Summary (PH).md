### **2️⃣ What is Data Science?**  

✔ **Definition:** Data Science is the process of using **data to answer questions** and make informed decisions.  
✔ **Interdisciplinary Nature:** Combines **statistics, computer science, and domain expertise**.  
✔ **Big Data & Growth:** Driven by massive data availability, computing advancements, and high demand for **data-driven decision-making**.  

✔ **Public Health Impact:**  
 - **Epidemiology:** Forecasting disease outbreaks using **real-time data**.  
 - **Global Health:** Analyzing trends in **malnutrition, vaccination rates, and healthcare accessibility**.  
 - **Health Economics:** Evaluating **cost-effectiveness of interventions** to optimize spending.  

✔ **Key Skills of a Public Health Data Scientist:**  
 - **Hacking skills (programming & automation)** → Data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization. 
 - **Mathematics & statistics** → Statistical modeling, risk analysis, and predictive modeling.

### **3️⃣ What is Data?**  

✔ **Definition:** Data is a **set of qualitative or quantitative values** collected for analysis and decision-making.  


✔ **Types of Data in Public Health:**  
- **Qualitative Data:** Categorical (e.g., disease classification, socioeconomic status).  
- **Quantitative Data:** Numeric, measurable (e.g., BMI, cholesterol levels, air pollution levels).  

✔ **Examples of Public Health Data Sources:**  
- **Epidemiological Surveillance** – WHO, CDC, and MOH databases tracking **disease incidence and mortality rates**.  
- **Census & Survey Data** – Understanding **health disparities and social determinants of health**.  
- **Electronic Medical Records (EMR)** – Analyzing **treatment adherence and patient outcomes**.  
- **Geospatial & Environmental Data** – Mapping **pollution exposure, water quality, and vector-borne diseases**.  

📌 **Key Insight:** **Data alone is useless** without a well-defined question. In public health, we start with a **health problem** and then identify **relevant data sources**.

### **5️⃣ The Data Science Process**  
✔ **A structured approach is key to any data science project.**  

📌 **5-Step Public Health Data Science Process:**  
  1️⃣ **Define the Question** – What public health issue are we addressing? (e.g., **What factors predict childhood malnutrition?**)  
  2️⃣ **Collect & Prepare the Data** – Gather **national health surveys, EMRs, or geospatial data**.  
  3️⃣ **Explore & Analyze the Data** – Apply **statistical methods & machine learning** to find risk factors.  
  4️⃣ **Visualize & Interpret Results** – Represent findings through **health maps, epidemiological curves, and policy reports**.  
  5️⃣ **Communicate Findings** – Inform policymakers, clinicians, and stakeholders through **dashboards, publications, and briefings**.  

✅ **Example: Public Health Application – COVID-19 Case Prediction**  
 - **Question:** How can we predict **hospitalization risk for COVID-19 patients?**  
 - **Data:** Patient demographics, comorbidities, prior medical history.  
 - **Analysis:** **Logistic regression & machine learning** to predict severe cases.  
 - **Findings:** Age, obesity, and pre-existing conditions strongly correlated with hospitalization.  
 - **Communication:** Results shared via **government health reports and academic publications**.  

✅ **Example: Hilary Parker’s Baby Name Analysis**  
 - Question: *Was “Hilary” the most rapidly “poisoned” name in U.S. history?*  
 - Data: Social Security baby names dataset (1880–2011).  
 - Analysis: Used **R programming** to calculate **relative risk of name decline**.  
 - Results: Confirmed **Hilary's popularity dropped the fastest in 1992**.  
 - Communication: Published findings via a **blog post with visualizations & R code on GitHub**.
