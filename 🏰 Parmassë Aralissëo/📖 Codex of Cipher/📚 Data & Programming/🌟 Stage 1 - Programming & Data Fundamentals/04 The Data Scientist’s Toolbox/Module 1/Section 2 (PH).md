## **📊 The Three Vs of Big Data**

![[Pasted image 20250217195113.png]]

### 1️⃣ **Volume** – Large datasets are common.
- Example: **YouTube** → 300+ hours of video uploaded **per minute**.
- **Public Health Example:**
    - **WHO & CDC** analyze **millions of health records** to track **epidemiological trends**.  

### 2️⃣ **Velocity** – Data is being generated at high speed.
- Example: **Real-time GPS tracking** for transport trucks.
- **Public Health Example:**
    - **Live COVID-19 dashboards** using real-time **case tracking** and **vaccination rates**.  

### 3️⃣ **Variety** – Data exists in different formats (structured & unstructured).
- Example: **YouTube data** includes:
    - **Videos & audio** (unstructured).
    - **Metadata (views, comments, video lengths)** (structured).
- **Public Health Example:**
    - **Healthcare data includes:**
        - **Clinical records** (structured).
        - **Social determinants of health (SDH)** from interviews, social media, and surveys (unstructured).
