#### **1️⃣ Rule 1: _If it’s not been done before, it can be done_**

    - This rule encourages **thinking outside the box** and **challenging norms**.
- **Anticipated Explanation:**
    
    - Property deals can often be constrained by traditional thinking. Innovators create value by finding **new approaches** to old problems.
    - Examples might include:

    - Many people limit themselves to what’s “commonly accepted,” but opportunities exist **in the grey areas** where few dare to go.
    - Emphasis on **thorough legal due diligence** to ensure compliance with local regulations.

    - **Seller financing** in markets where it’s less common but legal.

    - Long-term success in deal-making relies on **trust** and **reputation**.
- **Anticipated Explanation:**
    
    - Ethics go beyond legality—just because you _can_ do something doesn’t mean you _should_.
    - Importance of **fair treatment** to all parties involved, including sellers, buyers, tenants, and partners.
