### **🔹 Section 2: Large Language Model Basics – Public Health Perspective**  

📌 **How Do LLMs Work in Public Health Research?**  
 - AI **predicts the next word** based on context, which can help **generate structured summaries of health policies, analyze epidemiological trends, and develop cost-effectiveness models for interventions**.  
 - **Context matters**—AI **uses previous words to guide predictions**, making **well-structured prompts essential for accurate reporting in healthcare**.  
 - AI knowledge is **limited to its last training update**, requiring **manual input of recent disease surveillance data, health equity studies, and emerging healthcare policies**.  

📌 **The Role of Randomness in AI Responses for Public Health Analysis**  
 - AI-generated **responses vary** due to **built-in randomness**, making results **less predictable**—this variability can be beneficial for **generating multiple intervention strategies** but problematic for **standardized reporting in epidemiology**.  
 - **Randomness is beneficial for public health messaging** (e.g., crafting different health campaign slogans) but **problematic for statistical data analysis**.  
 - **Minimizing randomness requires structured prompts**, such as **asking for specific formats, constraints, and standardized outputs for health system evaluations**.  

📌 **Techniques to Improve Prompt Accuracy in Public Health Applications**  
   ✅ Use **clear, structured prompts**—avoid vague inputs when **drafting health policies or evaluating intervention outcomes**.  
   ✅ **Provide additional context**, such as recent disease trends, financial constraints in health budgeting, or target demographics for health interventions.  
   ✅ **Reinforce constraints** (e.g., “Summarize the impact of universal healthcare in three bullet points using WHO data”).  

📌 **Key Takeaways:**  
   ✔️ **AI outputs are based on probability, not true understanding**, requiring **precision in prompts for public health decision-making**.  
   ✔️ **Context shapes AI responses**—specificity leads to **better, more reliable answers for epidemiological forecasting and health policy assessments**.  
   ✔️ **Randomness is an AI feature**, useful for **exploring multiple health intervention approaches but requiring control for standardization in systematic reviews**.
