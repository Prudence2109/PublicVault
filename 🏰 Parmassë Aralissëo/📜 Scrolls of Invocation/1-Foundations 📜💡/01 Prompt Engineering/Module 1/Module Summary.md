### **🔹 Section 2: Large Language Model Basics**

📌 **How Do LLMs Work?**
 - AI **predicts the next word** based on context, **generating text dynamically**.
 - **Context matters**—AI **uses previous words to guide predictions**, making **well-structured prompts essential**.
 - AI knowledge is **limited to its last training update**—**manual context inclusion is necessary for recent events**.

📌 **The Role of Randomness in AI Responses**
 - AI-generated **responses vary** due to **built-in randomness**, making results **less predictable**.
 - **Randomness is beneficial for creative tasks** (e.g., storytelling, brainstorming) but **problematic for factual consistency**.
 - **Minimizing randomness requires structured prompts**, such as **asking for specific formats, constraints, and instructions**.

📌 **Techniques to Improve Prompt Accuracy**  
  ✅ Use **clear, structured prompts**—avoid vague inputs.  
  ✅ **Provide additional context** to guide AI responses.  
  ✅ **Reinforce constraints** (e.g., “Answer in one word,” “List three key points”).

📌 **Key Takeaways:**  
  ✔️ **AI outputs are based on probability, not true understanding**, requiring **precision in prompts**.
  ✔️ **Context shapes AI responses**—specificity leads to **better, more reliable answers**.  
  ✔️ **Randomness is an AI feature**, useful for **creativity but requiring management for factual reliability**.
